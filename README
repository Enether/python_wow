A console RPG game inspired by World of Warcraft.

I do not know where I'm going with this right now, we'll see what it ends up as.
This is going to be quite the fun architectural/oop problem. There are so many interactions that need to be
handled that it makes me feel overwhelmed.

That goes to say: everything made here is completely thought of by me. I realize that there must be numerous such games
whose source code is open online, but I want to create everything myself. That way you think and use your brain, as
opposed to blindly copying code.
