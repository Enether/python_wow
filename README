A console turn-based RPG game inspired by World of Warcraft written in Python 3.

The game itself is a turn based and works through user text commands. The plan is to create a somewhat complex game with good code structure.
It's still very basic and I suggest that you download it and play around to see what it's about.
I have never had another project open to contributors before, so if anything is unclear or needs improvement please contact me - familyguyuser192@windowslive.com

Intentionally not using pygame, the goal of this project is to see how far I can go without the use of too many third-party modules. (an exception is termcolor, which lets me print in color.)

You will need the termcolor module to get this project running.
